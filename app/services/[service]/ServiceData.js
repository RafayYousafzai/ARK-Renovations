      "Ultimate Renovations is the top provider of outdoor living spaces and exterior renovations in Calgary.

In Calgary, we experience essentially 2 seasons. In the summer, your patio serves as the hub for entertaining, visiting, relaxing, and even cooking, but it doesn’t have to stand ignored all winter long. Talk to us about the options for outdoor heaters, panoramic patio doors, and other comfort applications.",

      "In 1979, Ultimate was founded as a window cladding company. At the time, window cladding was a niche market with tons of demand. A few years later after a massive hailstorm struck Southern Alberta, our focus shifted to siding and roofing repair. Since then, we have become a highly recognized home renovation company in Calgary, but we hold fast to our roots. To this day, we offer roof replacements, siding repairs, window and door installations, framing, masonry, deck building, soffit, fascia, and gutter repair, and outdoor living spaces in Calgary. Our exterior renovations encompass everything from improving curb appeal to adding privacy and function.",

Unlike other home renovation companies in Calgary, we can even add a lower level to homes that don’t have one or maximize the amount of usable space by changing the layout or removing awkward posts and beams.
